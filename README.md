a set of tools for functional creative coding using react.

Todo
-----

- rethink approach to "Shape"
- write a "playground" package that just imports all the usual stuff you need e.g. `import * from "playground"` (imports utility fns, shapes, HOCs, etc. so you can quickly get going without half a page of imports)
- explore idea of "filters" for view layer. E.g. kalidascope component etc (mby using glsl shaders?)
